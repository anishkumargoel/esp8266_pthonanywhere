Send sensor data from ESP8266 to Python Flask server
In the Previous iteration, I had sent the sensor data from my IOT device to Google Sheets. Now, I am exporing sending data to a Python Flask WebApp via POST API calls
This would alow more server side freedom to further process the data. As of now, I am just logging the data into a CSV Flatfile
